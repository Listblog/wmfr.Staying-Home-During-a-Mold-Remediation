                    <b>Staying Home During a Mold Remediation</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s a fact, you and your family do not have to leave your home during a mold remediation. It all depends on where the work is needed and the amount of the work required. Also it is important to consider the health or mold sensitivity of anyone residing in the home at that time the work needs to be done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The question becomes is the entire home affected or only one room or area? Will you still be able to use the kitchen and at least one of your bathrooms without having to pass through any contaminated areas? Or maybe you can avoid entering or using that one area or room in your home while the remediation process is ongoing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mold remediation contractor will in all likelihood set up containment; plastic walls or barriers that are sealed with duct tape that will isolate the affected areas and prevent any mold spores from escaping into previously uncontaminated areas. This containment can be a major inconvenience to residents. These are a few of the things you should consider if you decide to remain in your residence:

                    <i>1. Is the HVAC System Affected By the Mold?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the HVAC system requires remediation and must be shut down, maintaining livable temperature conditions must be determined. Is it the middle of the summer? It could get quite uncomfortable without any air conditioning. Is it the middle of the winter? Can you stay in your home without any, or limited, heat? Also, the remediation contractor may require additional dehumidification and operating a dehumidifier could result in increased temperatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>2. Will the Noise from the Remediation Equipment Get on Your Nerves?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There will probably be one, maybe two, negative air machines running 24 hours a day. That’s in addition to possibly a dehumidifier and a few air movers (fans) to “stir” the air in the affected areas. If “white noise” drives you nuts, you may want to consider relocating during the time that the mold removal requires. One thing your contractor will <b>NOT</b> want you to do is for you to turn off his machines so that you can watch TV or sleep. A little irritation (noise) for a few days is much better than a lot of irritation (as in the mold sensitivities returning) because you turned machinery off after the contractor has left for the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>3. How Extensive Is the Work That Is Required to Remove the Mold?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A small area may be cleaned up quickly but a large project could go on for an extended period of time. Also, contents may have to be cleaned or relocated to other parts of the home, or even packed out to a storage location. Can you do without some of your belongings that will have to be cleaned or relocated? If these items are to be left in the home, will your family be able to comfortably maneuver around them while the work is ongoing? Think about a couple of bedrooms being affected and everyone having to sleep in the living room on the sofa or in sleeping bags on the floor. It may be “cool” for one night, but how “cool” will it be if it goes on for a week? In a case like this you should talk to your insurance agent. You may be entitled to be reimbursed if you have to relocate to a hotel or apartment while remediation and repairs are taking place.

                    <i>4. Personal Sensitivities May Be the Deciding Factors in Staying or Leaving</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is it truly safe for you and your family to remain in the home during a mold remediation project? Consult your medical professionals, especially if there are allergies, sensitivities, or other medical conditions that family members may have. Mold spores can be dispersed into the air with a minimal amount of air movement. The waving of your hand near a mold colony can create enough air movement to disturb mold spores. A qualified remediation expert understands this. This is why any expert will set up containment chambers and use negative air machines to help “wash” the air during the removal process. Still, it is possible for people outside the immediate work zone, who are sensitive to mold, to be negatively affected by an accidental release of containment. You should seek medical advice if this may become an issue for you or anyone residing in the home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every mold remediation requires a different approach. The process required for your home will probably not be exactly the same as the next person’s. So the question is, what will your contractor use during the remediation of the mold? Some contractors may use blasting to remove the mold from structural components. The blasting media used could be dry ice, soda, or even ground up walnut shells. Could this affect someone who is sensitive to these items? Some mold experts use hydrogen peroxide solutions that are dangerous to breathe without specialized respirators. The method used to remediate the mold may be the determining factor in whether you and your family remain in your home during the removal and cleaning process. Also, the use of specialized sealants may be required. Are you sensitive to these types of fumes and odors?

                    <i>5. Reconstruction and Repair Considerations</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dust, noise, and workers moving in, out, and through your home during the remediation and repair must also be considered. Will the fumes from paint, construction materials, or new flooring cause any of the home’s residents any discomfort? In addition, will the remodeling work be slowed down or hampered by you being present? After all, time is money, and if the removal and reconstruction takes more time, a greater cost to you (or your insurance company) may be incurred.
